# CS220P_Project3
This project is meant to simulate a runway and a small airport, with designated planes
(4) simulated with takeoffs and landings, some planes become idle. The plane data and runway
status are randomly assigned and the time intervals are simulating the planes between 4 am and 11 pm.
This airport doesn't include destinations but does include runway condition, and attempted calculation
of time intervals. Unfortunately, the time intervals do not show yet, but the differences
are calculated randomly. Plane status and information is also included and airport data is
printed at the end. This is not a large airport by any means, it is meant to be a small test run.
